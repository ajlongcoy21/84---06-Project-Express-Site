With the JSON object from the API we display the people in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. To get more detailed information (birthday, address, etc.) all that needs to be done is clicking on the persons image/cell and a modal popup appears with the information.",

The game starts by selecting a random, hidden phrase, which the player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard or with their keyboard keys. Each time the player guesses a letter, the program compares the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen. The player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose). Players can only guess a letter once.",
